# Waterfall Chart Builder Project

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite project for creating interactive waterfall charts with stacked bars support.

## Project Structure
- **Components**: Modular React components in `src/components/`

- **Utils**: Helper functions and constants in `src/utils/`
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks in `src/hooks/`

## Key Features
- Interactive waterfall charts with SVG rendering
- Stacked bars support for baseline and total values
- Data import/export (CSV, Excel, JSON, HTML)
- Real-time chart customization
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Libraries Used
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- PapaParse for CSV parsing
- XLSX for Excel file handling

## Development Guidelines
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Follow React best practices with hooks
- Maintain separation of concerns between components
- Use Tailwind classes for consistent styling
